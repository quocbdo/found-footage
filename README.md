Welcome to Found Footage! Just like what Forrest said about chocolates, you never quite know what you are going to get when you pick a movie to watch. Sometimes as the viewer you are unsure of what you want to watch or what you should watch. Some of you movie fanatics have some really awesome movies you want to share with others but don't know how to share it. This is where Found Footage's mission that we choose to accept comes into play. We want you as a visitor to be able to see what others have recommened to watch or you have an idea of what to watch such as Sharknado but are unsure of if it is a good idea or not to watch it. Let the community help give you an idea of what to watch or just go for it and watch it!
